# Library-Database-Management-System
My high school Computer science project.

Works on MS-DOS Turbo C++, which I had access to in my school computers. I didn't bother updating the code after school, and kinda just forgot 
that I even did this project. Many features and parts of the code had bugs which turned up later (I swear they were working initially :'|)

Feel free to message me if you wish to know more about this project.
